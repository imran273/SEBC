Boot Camp and Cloudera FCE's internal boot camp.

If you've received this repo as a ZIP file attachment, use the
instructions in the email to create your class repo. You can make
your GitHub repo Private if you wish, but it is not a free option.
For that reason, most students choose to make their GitHub repository
public.

<strong>NOTE</strong>: DO NOT add files to your repository through
the GitHub browser interface.


Use GitHub only to receive your lab work by pushing from your local
copy. Treat your GitHub repo like a backup to what is on your laptop.
Doing so will save a lot of headaches around maintaining the repo,
as we will explain in class. The only changes you should make directly
to your GitHub copy are Issues and Milestones, which are described in
`README.md`.

Add your instructor(s) as Collaborators to your GitHub repo. The lead
instructor's GitHub name is `manojsundaram`.

Adding your instructors as Collaborators will let them create <i>pull
requests</i> on your work. This is a way of editing your submissions
without changing them directly.  When you review instructor edits,
you can choose to reject them. Perhaps you would like to correct
problems a different way or ignore them for a while. The pull request
stands as a record of that interaction.

We use GitHub's Issues feature to establish a workflow around your
lab submissions.

For each lab section, such as Installation or Storage, you will use
an Issue to track your progress. You will also use GitHub labels
to mark the current state of each lab (e.g., `submitted`, `stuck`,
`review`). Your instructors will use labels to evaluate your work
once you have marked it for review (such as `complete` or 'incomplete`).

Finally, we will use GitHub milestones to separate your lab work
from your challenge work.

In a large class, it may take some time for an instructor to help you with a difficult problem.
Use the Issue to describe the problem and show what diagnostic work you've tried to isolate your problem.

You can include error messages or stack traces as Issue comments,
or take a screenshot to show your cluster's current condition.  It
is quite possible these initial steps will help you solve the problem
yourself. Otherwise, they will show an instructor what you have
tried so far.

Before you start any labs, make the following changes to your GitHub
repo:

* Add collaborators under `Settings -> Collaborators`.
* Enable `Issues` under `Settings -> Options`. Click the `Features` box and enable `Issues`.
* Click the `Issues` tab and the `Milestones` button
    * Create two milestones: `Labs` and `Challenges`
    * Set the deadlines for Thursday and Friday of the current week.
* Click the `Labels` button and change your labels as follows:
    * Change `bug` to `stuck`
    * Change `duplicate` to `started`
    * Change `enhancement` to `didNotSubmit`
    * Change `help wanted` to `complete`
    * Change `invalid` to `review`
    * Change `wontfix` to `incomplete`; set the label color to `#fbca04`.
    * Leave the `question` Issue as it is

One of the instructors will open an issue on your repo to acknowledge
your invitation to collaborate. They will also review your repo for
all the settings described here, and point out anything that isn't
setup correctly. This issue will be the only one you're asked to
close.  All other issues are to be closed by an instructor to show
no further review is needed.
